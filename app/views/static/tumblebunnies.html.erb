    <p> We have developed an exciting and highly successful approach to pre-school child development using gymnastics as a learning environment. Our 45 minute Tumblebunny classes are jam-packed with music, movement, fun and physical challenges. The Tumblebunnies have their own gym separate from the school- age children. The children climb, roll, jump, swing, bounce, hang, balance, and most importantly, never stop moving! </p>
    <p> Our wonderful coaches have a true love and enthusiasm for children. We provide a positive environment with lots of opportunities to succeed and grow. As soon as your child becomes mobile, a whole new world opens up including motor development activities at TRICKS.®  This is a critical brain development age. Children need to have many, many varied experiences from 0-5 years old. </p>
